# 🎄 advent-of-code-2020 🎄

Solutions to the Christmas themed Advent-of-Code challenges. 

My aim this year is to do as many as I can in Python, and then in Go. 

For now the repo contains a few things that I hope will save me repeating boring stuff each day.
There's also an example in each language.

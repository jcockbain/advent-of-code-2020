# ðŸŽ„ advent-of-code-2020 ðŸŽ„

Solutions to the Christmas themed Advent-of-Code challenges. 

My aim this year is to do as many as I can in Python, and then in Go. 

For now the repo contains a few things that I hope will save me repeating boring stuff each day.
For example, this is what I run each day to create my boilerplate. 

```bash

# creates dirs at go/day{day}, python/src/day{day}, python/test/day{day}
# from the templates in each of those repos
# then fetches input and places into each of those dirs
./new_day {day}

```

## Days 

- Template

    - [Python](python/src/template)
    - [Go](go/template)

- Day 1
